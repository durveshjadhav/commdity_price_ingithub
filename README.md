# Commodity Price Analytics System using MySQL
**Bussiness Objective**

This project aims to analyze price trends and availability patterns of  commodities across various Indian states and cities over a two-year period (2019â€“2020).

Using MySQL as the core database engine, the project focuses on building a clean, query-optimized dataset and deriving valuable business insights such as:

- Top costliest commodities

- Variety distribution

- Price fluctuation by region and time

- Supply trends across states

These insights can help governments, logistics companies, and supply chain analysts monitor commodity market behavior, price inflation, and regional demand/supply variance.
