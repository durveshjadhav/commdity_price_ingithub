# Commodity Price Analytics System using MySQL
**Bussiness Objective**

This project aims to analyze price trends and availability patterns of  commodities across various Indian states and cities over a two-year period (2019â€“2020).

Using MySQL as the core database engine, the project focuses on building a clean, query-optimized dataset and deriving valuable business insights such as:

- Top costliest commodities

- Variety distribution

- Price fluctuation by region and time

- Supply trends across states

These insights can help governments, logistics companies, and supply chain analysts monitor commodity market behavior, price inflation, and regional demand/supply variance.

These are the project questions with thier solutions.

Question 1: Get the common commodities between the Top 10 costliest commodities of 2019 and 2020?

Question 2: What is the maximum difference between the prices of a commodity at one place vs the other 
for the month of Jun 2020? Which commodity was it for?

Question 3: Arrange the commodities in order based on the number of varieties in which they are available, 
with the highest one shown at the top. Which is the 3rd commodity in the list?

Question 4: In the state with the least number of data points available. 
Which commodity has the highest number of data points available?

Question 5: What is the price variation of commodities for each city from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020. 
			Which commodity has seen the highest price variation and in which city?
